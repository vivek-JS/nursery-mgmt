# Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive role-based access control for WhatsApp Management and Payments features in the nursery management system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. WhatsApp Management Access Control
- **Restricted to**: SUPER_ADMIN only
- **Implementation**: 
  - Menu item hidden for non-SUPER_ADMIN users
  - Component-level access guard with "Access Denied" message
  - Route protection

### 2. Payments Management Access Control
- **Restricted to**: ACCOUNTANT and SUPER_ADMIN
- **Implementation**:
  - Menu item hidden for non-ACCOUNTANT/non-SUPER_ADMIN users
  - Component-level access guard with "Access Denied" message
  - Route protection

### 3. Super Admin Privileges
- **SUPER_ADMIN has access to**: All features including WhatsApp and Payments
- **Implementation**: SUPER_ADMIN bypasses all role restrictions

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Role Utilities (`src/utils/roleUtils.js`)
```javascript
// New utility functions added:
- useHasWhatsAppAccess() // SUPER_ADMIN only
- useHasPaymentsAccess() // ACCOUNTANT or SUPER_ADMIN
- useHasMenuAccess(menuTitle) // Generic menu access checker
```

### 2. Updated Menu System (`src/router/routes/dashboardRoutes.js`)
```javascript
// Added role restrictions to menu items:
- Labs: ["LABORATORY_MANAGER", "SUPER_ADMIN"]
- Payments: ["ACCOUNTANT", "SUPER_ADMIN"] 
- WhatsApp Management: ["SUPER_ADMIN"]
```

### 3. Enhanced MenuPath Class (`src/router/core.js`)
```javascript
// Added allowedRoles parameter to MenuPath constructor
constructor(title, icon, route, alias = null, allowedRoles = null)
```

### 4. Updated Private Layout (`src/layout/privateLayout/index.jsx`)
```javascript
// Added role-based menu filtering:
- hasMenuAccess() function checks user role against menu allowedRoles
- SUPER_ADMIN bypasses all restrictions
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing menu items
```

### 5. Component-Level Access Guards

#### WhatsApp Management (`src/pages/private/whatsapp/WhatsAppManagement.js`)
- Access check at component start
- Shows "Access Denied" card for unauthorized users
- Clean, user-friendly error message

#### Payments Management (`src/pages/private/payments/index.jsx`)
- Access check at component start
- Shows "Access Denied" card for unauthorized users
- Clear role requirements displayed

## Role Hierarchy

1. **SUPER_ADMIN**: Full access to all features
2. **ACCOUNTANT**: Access to Payments + standard features
3. **LABORATORY_MANAGER**: Access to Labs + standard features
4. **Other roles**: Standard features only (no WhatsApp, no Payments)

## Security Features

- **Menu-level filtering**: Unauthorized menu items are hidden
- **Component-level guards**: Direct URL access blocked
- **User-friendly messages**: Clear explanation of access requirements
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Login as different user roles**:
   - SUPER_ADMIN: Should see all menu items including WhatsApp and Payments
   - ACCOUNTANT: Should see Payments but not WhatsApp
   - LABORATORY_MANAGER: Should see Labs but not WhatsApp or Payments
   - Other roles: Should see standard features only

2. **Direct URL access**:
   - Try accessing `/u/whatsapp` as non-SUPER_ADMIN → Should show "Access Denied"
   - Try accessing `/u/payments` as non-ACCOUNTANT/non-SUPER_ADMIN → Should show "Access Denied"

3. **Menu visibility**:
   - WhatsApp Management should only appear for SUPER_ADMIN
   - Payments should only appear for ACCOUNTANT and SUPER_ADMIN

## Files Modified

1. `src/utils/roleUtils.js` - Added new role checking utilities
2. `src/router/routes/dashboardRoutes.js` - Added role restrictions to menu items
3. `src/router/core.js` - Enhanced MenuPath class
4. `src/layout/privateLayout/index.jsx` - Added role-based menu filtering
5. `src/pages/private/whatsapp/WhatsAppManagement.js` - Added access guard
6. `src/pages/private/payments/index.jsx` - Added access guard

## Future Enhancements

- Add more granular permissions (e.g., read-only vs full access)
- Implement audit logging for access attempts
- Add role management interface for SUPER_ADMIN
- Extend role-based access to other sensitive features
