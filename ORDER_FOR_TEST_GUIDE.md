# Order For Functionality Test Guide

## üß™ Testing Steps for Web Application

### 1. Access the Application
- Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000`
- Login to the application with your credentials
- Navigate to the Orders section and click "Add New Order"

### 2. Locate the Order For Section
The Order For section should be visible with these indicators:

#### ‚úÖ **Visual Indicators to Look For:**
1. **Debug Box**: Yellow warning box showing "DEBUG: Order For section is rendering. Toggle state: OFF/ON"
2. **Section Title**: "üë§ Order For (Optional)" 
3. **Checkbox**: "Place order for someone else?"
4. **Alternative Toggle**: Blue box with "Alternative Toggle (for testing)" and a button

#### üîç **Where to Find It:**
- Scroll down in the Add Order form
- It should appear AFTER the "Plant & Slot Details" section
- It should appear BEFORE the "Payment Management" section

### 3. Test the Toggle Functionality

#### **Test 1: Checkbox Toggle**
1. Click the checkbox next to "Place order for someone else?"
2. Verify the debug box shows "Toggle state: ON"
3. Check browser console for: `üîÑ Order For checkbox clicked, current state: false`

#### **Test 2: Alternative Button Toggle**
1. Click the "‚óã Order For DISABLED" button in the blue box
2. Verify it changes to "‚úì Order For ENABLED"
3. Check browser console for: `üîÑ Alternative toggle clicked, current state: false`

### 4. Test Input Fields (When Enabled)

When the toggle is ON, you should see:
1. **Name field**: "Name *" (required)
2. **Mobile Number field**: "Mobile Number *" (required, 10 digits)
3. **Address field**: "Address *" (required, multiline)
4. **Info Alert**: Blue info box explaining the purpose

### 5. Test Form Validation

#### **Test 3: Required Field Validation**
1. Enable Order For toggle
2. Try to submit the form without filling Order For fields
3. Should see error: "Please enter name for the person the order is for"

#### **Test 4: Mobile Number Validation**
1. Enter a mobile number with less than 10 digits
2. Try to submit
3. Should see error: "Please enter a valid 10-digit mobile number for the person the order is for"

### 6. Test Order Creation

#### **Test 5: Complete Order with Order For**
1. Fill all required fields (farmer details, plant selection, etc.)
2. Enable Order For toggle
3. Fill Order For fields:
   - Name: "Test Person"
   - Mobile: "9876543210"
   - Address: "Test Address, Test City"
4. Submit the order
5. Check browser network tab for the API request
6. Verify the payload includes `orderFor` data:

```json
{
  "orderFor": {
    "name": "Test Person",
    "address": "Test Address, Test City", 
    "mobileNumber": 9876543210
  }
}
```

### 7. Test Order Retrieval

#### **Test 6: Verify Order For in Response**
1. After creating an order with Order For data
2. Navigate to order list/management
3. View the created order
4. Verify the Order For information is displayed

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Order For Section is Not Visible:

1. **Check Console Errors**: Open browser dev tools (F12) and check for JavaScript errors
2. **Scroll Down**: The section might be below the visible area
3. **Check Network**: Ensure all CSS/JS files are loading properly
4. **Clear Cache**: Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

### If Toggle Doesn't Work:

1. **Check Console**: Look for the debug messages when clicking
2. **Check State**: Verify the debug box shows state changes
3. **Check Form Data**: Use React DevTools to inspect formData.orderForEnabled

### If Validation Doesn't Work:

1. **Check Console**: Look for validation error messages
2. **Check Network**: Verify the API request includes orderFor data
3. **Check Backend**: Ensure the backend is running and accepting orderFor data
